 1. link with CSS style, using emment from VScode 

2. with F12 inspect tool in chrome, turn on toggle device toolbar to resize the Window to 500 pixel. Because we do mobile-design priorty first.  

3. goto style-guide.md >> convert HSL color to HEX style. with google rgb to hex

4. find your background color one by one...by div 5 section, and set backgroundd color

5. then, make a big div as container to contain 5 divs. #testimonial-grid-container. set its css to padding 5%. why. mobile design photo. 5% is topn bottom, 3% is left right. check padding property documentation.

6. set color to text of each div.  then margin of 5 divs. then define class class="grid-item" for 5 divs. for easy CSS style selector. margin : 20px. then padding 20px

7. now mobile layout is good. Change to check Laptop mode. with chrome browser F12.

8. now u determine how many breakpoints. eg. tablet/phone/laptop. but for now. we think 1 breakpoint only. like Bootstrap say small-medium is around 5xx-7xx pixel.

9. in CSS, do @media (min-width :576px). means once we hit 576pixel, needs to resemble desktop-design.jpg
- layout for desktop.
idea 1: one container for 4 div at left, one container for 1 div at right. 
 -then further divide left container into up and down container.
 display : flex
 flex-direction : row
 -ok proceed.
10. <div id="main-left"> 
    <div id="top">
    <div id="bottom">


11. in css. add #testimonial-grid-container{
        display: flex;
    
    from browser, seems like div5 taking half, we dont need that much, add this :
    #testimonial-5{
        flex-basis: 25%;
    }
12. check again layout , add:
    #main-left{
        display: flex;
        flex-direction: column;
    }

    #top{
        display: flex;
    }

    #bottom{
        display: flex;
    }

13. copy div1-4 into @media here, to edit their flex-basis one by one.
from desktop-design.jpg , seems like ratio is 75:25

14. then set max-width to 750px in #testimonial-grid-container{
    or adjust all.
    flex-basis left right to 70 30
    flex-basi top bottom to 65 35
   or anything looks good like photo.

15. #main-left .grid-item{
        margin-right: 15px;
    }


16. housekeeping CSS by re-order. and combine display flex into one single CSS rule.
 also for flex-basis or 25%/75% or 35%/65% together. like this

    #testimonial-grid-container, #main-left,#top
    {
        display: flex;
    }

    #testimonial-1,#testimonial-4{
        flex-basis: 65%;
    }

    #testimonial-2, #testimonial-3{
        flex-basis: 35%;
    }

    then place all these flex related below the display flex 

17. settle on layout for desktop. now move back to mobile design. 
puttting in back all info.
 img tag x1
 p tag x3
 h4 tag x1
        <img src="./images/image-daniel.jpg" alt="daniel profile">
        <p>Daniel Clifford</p>
        <p>Verified Graduate</p>
        <h4>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, 
          in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h4>
        
         <p>“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a 
          transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up 
          for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
          The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
          the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p> 

18. after refill 5div info, found the css style 5 divs are same. can do one time. so, lets create common style and style together.
  for photo , name and verified graduate. lets use flexbox  from .header, vscode generate a class of header for u. >>> <div class="header"></div>
  also . <div class="header-txt"></div>
19. at CSS, add .header{
                    display: flex;
                    align-items: center;
                    }
20. for round profile picture
.header img{
    border-radius: 50%;
}

21. add margin-bottom: 20px; to .header so that text is 20px below.
margin-right: 10px; to .header img

.grid-item h4{
    margin-bottom: 20px;
}

border-radius: 5px; to .grid-item{}

22. shadow. box-shadow: 1px 1px 2px 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.2) ;
can use online shadow generator.

23. font. from style guide, font size is 13px. at grid.item{}
font-size: 1.2rem; for grid-item h4  =  120% of parent font size.

24. font family . >>https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow+Semi+Condensed
 click both 500 and 600, and copy link to html .

 <link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Barlow+Semi+Condensed:wght@500;600&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">


25. for body {} add in from google also.
body{
    background-color: #ecf2f8;
    font-family: font-family: 'Barlow Semi Condensed', sans-serif; ;
}

26. white cards have grey textcolor and combine:
#testimonial-3, #testimonial-5 {
    background-color: white ;
    color : #48556a
}
from style guide, also got 50% opacity for verified graduate, and 70% opacity for paragrapth""

27. but affected th name, we add class of name. press ALT and click all the p , then type  class = "name"
and style in css.

 .name{} wont work.

.header .name{
    opacity: 100%;
}                   will working, because 2 selector take precedency than 1 selector.

font-size: 1rem;  refer to 100% of 16 px

28. font-weight: we can use 400 becoz we import it in link

.grid-item h4{
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    font-size: 1.2rem;
    font-weight: 600;   

}

29. purple card got double quote image. insert it. <img id="quote" src="./images/bg-pattern-quotation.svg" alt="quote">

#quote{
    position: absolute;
    right : 20px;
}

relative to viewport, position this image, 20px from the right.
but we want it relative to griditem. so set the position of grid-item1 to relative.

30. make theimage behind text. set  z-index: 1 to image;
below text, above purple card.
set z-index 0 to #testimonial-1
set z-index 3 to grid-item h4{}
!!to use z-index, must add position relative;

31.lastly post to github link to show as project.
